 * as well as new additional helper methods should not be placed in here,
 * but be implemented within the skeleton class 'Friend'.
 *
 * Attributes can have default and null values set via their options. The keys
 * are named 'default_value' and 'null_value' respectively.
 *
 * This class extends the 'ReferencedEntity' class to get the change events and
 * validation handling behaviour of that class.
