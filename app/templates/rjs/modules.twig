{#
    You may define modules here, whose whose dependencies should be traced on compilation (r.js optimization).
    When all you want to do is add custom modules, you can put those in the "rjs/additional_modules.twig" file.

    For each defined module here you can use the following options:
    - "name": (mandatory) name of the module to trace dependencies for
    - "include": array of module names to additionaly include in this module
    - "exclude": array of module names to exclude from this module (even though the module specifies the dependency; useful for libraries like jquery)
    - "create": boolean value to indicate that this module is a custom one that should be created despite being non-existant in the source folder
#}
    modules: [
        {{ embed_all_main_modules() | raw }},
        {% include "rjs/additional_modules.twig" ignore missing %}
    ]
