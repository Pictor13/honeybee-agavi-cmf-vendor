{#
    You may define modules here, whose whose dependencies should be traced on compilation (r.js optimization).

    For each defined module here you can use the following options:
    - "name": (mandatory) name of the module to trace dependencies for
    - "include": array of module names to additionaly include in this module
    - "exclude": array of module names to exclude from this module (even though the module specifies the dependency; useful for libraries like jquery)
    - "create": boolean value to indicate that this module is a custom one that should be created despite being non-existant in the source folder

    Please note, that non-AMD modules like ckeditor are no good candidates for optimization into compiled modules. The
    ckeditor for example does not find it's own config and styles if it's compiled without those. You can only fix this
    by converting the lib to AMD style OR try to define all necessary files via "include" below (which probably fails).

    Example definitions:
#}
{#
        {
            name: "Core/All",
            create: true,
            include: [
                "Core/Main",
                "User/Main",
                "lodash/main",
                "Core/Widget",
                "Core/ui/Tabs",
                "Core/ui/DatePicker"
            ]
        }
#}
{#      {
            name: "_project/Main",
            exclude: [
                "Core/Main"
            ]
        },
        {
            name: "Core/Examples",
            exclude: [
                "Core/Main"
            ]
        },
        {
            name: "TotallyCustomModule",
            include: [
                "Core/Example_1"
            ],
            create: true
        }
#}
